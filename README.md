# Otter Scholar! 🦦👩🏻‍💻
by Karen Yuan, Xandra Wong, Amy Li and Shiwen Zhang

### About
We are four UCSB undergraduates studying computer science and have developed this project in participation for SB Hacks X. Our app is focused on helping students and scholars maintain focus when working on school, work, or anything else! It is easy to use and includes a timer option for the student to complete tasks with a Pomodoro timer or a custom timer.

### Technologies
Our project uses the languages Python, HTML and CSS. We used Figma to design a wireframe and VSCode to program the app.
