# Otter Scholar!
by Karen Yuan, Xandra Wong, Amy Li and Shiwen Zhang

### About
Our app is focused on helping students and scholars maintain focus when working on school, work, or anything else! It is easy to use and includes a timer option for the student to complete tasks with a Pomodoro timer or a custom timer.

### Technologies
Our project uses the languages Python, HTML and CSS. We used Figma to design a wireframe and VSCode to program the app.
