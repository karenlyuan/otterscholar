### About
We are four UCSB undergraduates studying computer science and have developed this project in participation for SB Hacks X. Our website is focused on helping students and scholars maintain focus when working on school, work or anything else! It is easy to use and includes a timer option for the student to complete tasks with a Pomodoro timer or a custom timer. The website also includes also includes a live calendar clock to display the current day, date and time.

### Technologies
Our project uses the languages Python, HTML and CSS. We used Figma to design a wireframe and VSCode to program the app. Our libraries used include datetime, random, time, playsound and pygame. We also used the Flask framework to develop our web application with Python.
